## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** Instead, please contact [$PROJECT_EMAIL](mailto:$PROJECT_EMAIL) and a representative will be in contact to arrange secure transfer of the necessary information. You should receive a response within 24 hours.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
